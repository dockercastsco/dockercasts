the dockercasts site is a good example of using docker in a development environment
vagrant is used to set up a virtual machine with everything we need. Lets look at the Vagrantfile first
next lets look at the ansible playbook that is used
lets look at our compose yaml file next
  the app image is built using the Dockerfile in the app directory
next we will look at that Dockerfile
now that the app image is built we can ssh into the virtual machine and run the app using docker-compose -f compose/dev.yml up app
that is how we use docker to setup the development environment for dockercasts
